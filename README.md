# vending_machine
This project implements a vending machine in Verilog, fully compatible with Xilinx Vivado. The design demonstrates a finite state machine (FSM) approach to handle multiple products and coin inputs. It is intended for FPGA simulation and educational purposes, allowing users to understand sequential logic, synchronous design, and hardware modeling.
